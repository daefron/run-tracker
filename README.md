## Why this project?

So my girlfriend got me a Fitbit for me birthday...

I had just started getting into running, and I found the official Fitbit app didn't allow for easy comparison of exercises, so I decided to make a dashboard for tracking my runs.

Dealing with the Fitbit API's rate limit made me want to learn backend as well, so this also includes a database with API for interfacing with the Fitbit API more efficiently.

## About this project

This is a custom made dashboard that visualises all of my tracked runs using data gathered from the Fitbit API.
